# __COMPONENT_NAME__ contributor instructions

Read `MOLSYSSUITE_GUIDE.md` before making changes. It routes suite-wide policy,
compatibility, tooling and cross-component proposals to `uibcdf/molsyssuite` while this
repository remains authoritative for its implementation and product behavior.

Use English in code, documentation, issues and commits. Keep changes focused, test
user-visible behavior, preserve human work and never commit secrets.

Run these local gates before committing:

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
pytest
python devtools/devguide_index.py --check
```

Follow `devguide/reporting_protocol.md` for every durable bug or proposal record. Open
the owning GitHub issue first, regenerate indexes after lifecycle changes, and archive
resolved records instead of deleting them.
